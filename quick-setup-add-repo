update a file:
when you change a file which is already in the repository, 
you have to git add it again if you want it to be staged. 
Hope it helps. You have to use git add to stage them, 
or they won't commit. ... So when you git commit , t
hose changes won't be added since they are not staged.

   edit files, check with "git status -s"
   git add "files changed"
   git commit -m "update"
   git push -u origin master
   
   [donghu@fedora bash]$ git status -s
 M getopt
[donghu@fedora bash]$ git commit -m "upd"
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

====================   ssh   ========
Create a new repository, or reuse an existing one.

Generate a new SSH key:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
Copy the contents of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to your SSH keys in your GitHub account settings.

Test SSH key:

$ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi developius! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Change directory into the local clone of your repository (if you're not already there) and run:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
Now try editing a file (try the README) and then do:

$ git commit -am "Update README.md"
$ git push
You should not be asked for a username or password. If it works, your SSH key is correctly configured.
